# Here we are coding for a function that returns whether a provided pawn move for chess is valid. You should expect to write more than just this function. Also write the supporting logic and structures needed to accomplish the goal. You do not have to unit test, but you should approach this problem as if we will unit test your code.

For a chess refresher, here is the setup:
•	8x8 board
•	Two players playing against each other, starting with the same number and type of pieces on opposite sides of the board.
•	Each player has pieces that are a specific color

The pawn can move in the following ways:
1.	Can move forward 1 space if the space is empty.
2.	Can move forward 1 or 2 spaces if the pawn is at its starting position. The spaces also must be empty.
3.	Can move diagonally 1 space if there is an enemy piece to capture in that space.

We are focusing on only the legal moves for each chessmate.
